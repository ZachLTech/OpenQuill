# Blogz

todo: make readme :)

This is gonna be a simple yet versatile self-hosted blog platform for anyone to whip up an instance of easily on their server and have many users if they decide to do so :)


Things I want to implement eventually:
- hiding blogs
- custom blog sitewide configs
- user customizable blog color schemes
- light mode maybe
- optimize by adding admin, frozen, and other user variables to jwt token to minimize DB queries
- also optimize with nuxt caching features (I gotta learn that)
- add blog pagination (not hard but like I really wanna work on other projects so I'll do it later lol)
